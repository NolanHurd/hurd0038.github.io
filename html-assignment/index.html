    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="images/nolan.jpg" alt="picture of nolan hurd" width="150", height="150">
    <p>I am a student in the <em>Interactive Media Design </em>program at Algonquin College. It&apos;s been three years since I&apos;ve been in school but it feels like it&apos;s coming back incredibly naturally! I&apos;m very much enjoying all of the courses that this program has to offer! Learning online from the comfort of my own home is an incredibly interesting and fun experience. It&apos;s my 1<sup>st</sup> time being educated this way, and so far it&apos;s going great!</p>
    <p>I&apos;m a very big fan of media, both in how it is created and how it is presented. The form of media I have the most interest in is video games, as I&apos;m always in awe of the breathtaking visuals and intuitive gameplay that they have to offer. I look forward to new horizons and learning more as I partake in this program!</p>
